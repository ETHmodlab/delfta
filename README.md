## Installation

### Pre-requisites

Currently supported OSs include both Linux and Mac OS (10.5, x86_64 only). Basic build tools (_e.g_. make) are currently required for installation. Under Ubuntu, for instance, these are available under the `build-essential` package. The required package might be named differently on different distributions.

While the Linux installation fully supports GPU-acceleration via cudatoolkit, only CPU inference is currently available under Mac OS.

### Installation via conda

We recommend and support installation via the [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) package manager. First clone the repository to obtain the latest version or download one of the provided stable releases:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/josejimenezluna/delfta
```

Afterwards, move into the root repo directory and build the provided Makefile via:

```bash
make
```

which will create a new conda environment named `delfta` and install all the required dependencies as well as this package according to the requirements of your host operating system. After the installation has completed, you can now activate the environent and use the package via

```bash
conda activate delfta
```


### Installation via Docker

We also provide a CUDA-enabled Dockerfile for easier management. Build the container by

```bash
docker build -t delfta . 
```

Attach to the provided container with:

```bash
docker run -it delfta bash
```

## Quick start

```python
from openbabel.pybel import readstring
mol = reastring("smi", "CCO")

from delfta.calculator import DelftaCalculator
calc = DelftaCalculator(tasks=["E_form", "E_homo"])
preds = calc.predict(mol)

print(preds)
```

TODO further examples

Further documentation on how to use the package is available under [ReadTheDocs](http://toinclude.html).
